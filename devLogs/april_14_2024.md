#### Vectors

- Learnt Why we use Vectors which are constructed through Heap space and hence doesn't need
  to be size constrained at their initialization.
- Learnt Arrays are constructed from stack and hence needs fixed size. 
- Learnt syntax of declaring vectors: let mut v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
- Learnt the difference between loop and maps with vectors.
